#What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple?

-The primary difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable as opposed to lists which 
are mutable. Therefore, it is possible to change a list but not a tuple. The contents of a tuple
cannot change once they have been created in Python due to the immutability of tuples.
