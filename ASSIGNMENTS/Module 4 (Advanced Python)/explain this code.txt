Que : What happens when "1"== 1 is executed?

-> When "1" == 1 is executed in python, it will return 'False'.This is because
   the two operands have different types: "1" is a string and 1 is an integer.

-> In python the '==' operator is used to check if two values are equal.When comparing
   two values with the '==' operator, Python first checks that the two values are having 
   the same types. If the types are different, Python will automatically try to convert
   one of the values to the type of the other value to see if they can be compared. If the 
   types cannnot be converted, the comparison will always return 'False'.

-> In this case, Python will try to convert the integer '1' to a string so that it can be 
   compared to the string '"1"'. However '"1"' and '1' are not equivalent when treated as 
   strings and integers, respectively, so the comparison will always return 'False'.
