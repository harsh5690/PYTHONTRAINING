Que : Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? 
      What is init? Or What Is A Constructor In Python?

-> Inheritance is a key feature of object-oriented programming that
   allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

-> In python, you can create a new class by deriving it from an existing class,
   and the new class will inherit all the attributes and behaviors of the parent
   class.

-> This relationship between classes is often referred to as an "is-a" relationship.

-> Here's an example that demonstrates inheritance in python.

	class animal:
	    def __init__(self,name):
	        self.name = name
	
	    def speak(self):
	        print("This animal makes a sound.")

	class dog(animal):
	    def speak(self):
	        print("Woof!!")

	class cat(animal):
	    def speak(self):
	        print("Meow!!")

	# create instances of the derived classes
	d = dog("Buddy")
	c = cat("Whiskers")

	
	# call the overridden method on the derived classes
	d.speak() #output: Woof!!
	c.speak() #output: Meow!!

-> In this example, we have a base class called "animal" which has a "__init__" method
   (constructor) and a "speak" method.

-> The "__init__"" method initializes the "name" attribute, and the "speak" method prints
   a generic sound of an animal.

-> We then define two derived classes, "dog" and "cat", which inherit from the 
   "animal" class. The derived classes override the "speak" method to provide their
   specific sounds.

-> We create instances of the "dog" and "cat" classes, and when we call the "speak"
   method on these instances, the overridden method in the respective derived class 
   is executed.

-> The "__init__" method, also known as a constructor, is a special method in python
   classes that gets called when an object is instantiated from the class.

-> It is used to initialize the attributes of the object.The "self" parameter refers to the
   instance of the object being created.

-> By convention, the constructor method is named "__init__", and it is commonly used to
   set up the initial state of an object by assigning values to its attributes.
