Que : What relationship is appropriate for Course and Faculty?

-> In the context of a university or educational institution, 
   the relationship between a "Course" and "Faculty" can be 
   represented as a many-to-many relationship, typically 
   through an intermediary entity such as "Teaching" or "Assignment."

-> Here's a brief explanation of the relationship and its possible implementation:

-> Many-to-Many Relationship: A course can have multiple faculty members, and 
   a faculty member can teach multiple courses. This relationship suggests that 
   multiple courses can be assigned to multiple faculty members, indicating a 
   many-to-many relationship between the "Course" and "Faculty" entities.

-> Intermediary Entity: To represent the many-to-many relationship, you can 
   introduce an intermediary entity, such as "Teaching" or "Assignment," 
   which captures the association between a specific course and a specific 
   faculty member. This intermediary entity will typically have additional 
   attributes, such as the semester or year in which the faculty member teaches 
   the course.

-> Entity Relationships: The "Course" and "Faculty" entities will have a many-to-many 
   relationship with the intermediary entity. Each "Course" can be associated with multiple 
   "Faculty" members through the intermediary entity, and each "Faculty" member can be 
   associated with multiple "Courses."

-> Here's a simplified example of how the relationship might be represented 
   in Python using classes:


	class Course:
            def __init__(self, course_id, course_name):
                self.course_id = course_id
                self.course_name = course_name
                self.faculty = []

            def assign_faculty(self, faculty):
                self.faculty.append(faculty)

	class Faculty:
            def __init__(self, faculty_id, faculty_name):
                self.faculty_id = faculty_id
                self.faculty_name = faculty_name
                self.courses = []

            def teach_course(self, course):
                self.courses.append(course)

-> In this example, the Course class has attributes for course ID (course_id) and course name 
   (course_name). It also has a list attribute faculty that stores the associated faculty members.

-> The Faculty class has attributes for faculty ID (faculty_id) and faculty name (faculty_name). 
   It also has a list attribute courses that stores the courses taught by the faculty member.

-> To establish the relationship, you can use methods such as assign_faculty() in the Course 
   class and teach_course() in the Faculty class to associate the appropriate entities.

-> This representation allows for the flexibility of assigning multiple faculty members to a 
   course and assigning multiple courses to a faculty member, capturing the many-to-many 
   relationship between "Course" and "Faculty."
