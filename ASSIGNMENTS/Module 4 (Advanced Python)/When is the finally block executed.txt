Que : When is the finally block executed?

-> The 'finally' block in a 'try-except-finally' block is executed 
   regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.

-> The syntax of the 'try-except-finally' block is as follows:

	try:
	    # code that might raise an error
	except ExceptionType:
	    # handle the exception
	finally:
	    # always execute, whether or not an exception was raised

-> Here, the 'try' block contains the code that might raise an exception.
   If an exception of type 'ExceptionType' (or any of its subclasses) is raised 
   in the 'try' block, then the corresponding 'except' block is executed to 
   handle the exception. 

-> If no exception is raised, then the code in the 'finally' block will be executed.

-> The 'finally' clause is useful for writing code that should always be executed,
   regradless of whether or not an exception was raised. 

-> For ex., you might use it to clean up resources such as files or network connections
   or to ensure that certain actions are always performed, such as logging or closing a GUI window.

-> Note that the 'finally' clause is optional in a 'try-except' block. you can use a 'try-except'
   block without a 'finally' clause to catch and handle exceptions without executing any code that
   should always be executed.
