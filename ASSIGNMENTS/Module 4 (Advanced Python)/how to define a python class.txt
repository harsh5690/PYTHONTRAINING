Que : How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? 
      Give An Example Of A Python Class.


-> In python, you can define a class using the 'class' keyword.
   Here's an example of a simple python class:	

 	class person:
	    def __init__(self,name,age):
	        self.name = name
	        self.age = age

	    def greet(self):
		print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}, and I am {self.age} years old.")

-> In this example, we define a class called 'person'.The class has two attributes -
   'name' and 'age' - which are set using a constructor method called - '__init__'.
   The constructor takes two parameters, 'name' and 'age', and initializes the 
   corresponding attributes.

-> The class also has a method called 'greet', which takes no parameters and simply
   prints a greeting message using the person's name and age.

-> The 'self' keyword is used in python to refer to the object that the method is 
   being called on. It is similar to the 'this' keyword in other programming 
   languages.When you create an instance of a class, you can call its methods using
   the dot notation, and the 'self' parameter will be automatically passed in.

-> Here's an example of how to create an instance of the 'person' class and call its 
   'greet' method:

	p = person("Parshwa",25)
	p.greet()   # output: Hello, my name is Parshwa, and I am 25 years old.

-> In this example, we create an instance of the 'person' class with the name 
   'Parshwa' and age 25, and assign it to the variable 'p'.We then call the 'greet'
   method on the 'p' object, which print out the greeting message.
