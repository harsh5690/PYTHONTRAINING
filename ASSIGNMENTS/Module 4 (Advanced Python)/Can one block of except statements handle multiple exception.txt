Que : Can one block of except statements handle multiple exception?

-> Yes, you can use single 'except' block to handle multiple exceptions 
   by specifying them as a tuple of exception types.

-> ex.,
	
	try:
	    # code that might raise an exception
	except(exceptionTyep1,exceptionType2):
	    # handilng both the exceptions


-> Here, the 'except' block handles both the 'exceptionType1' and 
   'exceptionType2' exceptions.

-> If an exception of either type is raised in 'try' block, the corresponding
   'except' block will be executed to handle the exception.

-> Using a tuple of exception types in a single 'except' block is useful  when 
   you want to handle multiple related exceptions in the same way.

-> For ex., you might use it to handle different types of I/O errors, or 
   different types of network errors.

-> It's also worth nothing that you can have multiple 'except'blocks in a 
   'try-except' block to handle different types of exceptions separately.

-> If an exception is raised that matches the type of one of the except blocks, 
   only that except block will be executed, and the other except blocks will be skipped.
