Que : How many except statements can a try-except block have? 
      Name Some built-in exception classes:

-> A try-execpt block can have multiple 'except' statements to
   handle different types of exceptions.
-> The syntax of try-except statement is:

   try:
       # code that might raise an exception
   except Exceptiontype1:
       # handling exception type 1
   except Exceptiontype2:
       # handling exception type 2
   except Exceptiontype3:
       # handling exception type 3
   .
   . 
   .
   except ExceptiontypeN:
       # handling exception type N

-> where 'Exceptiontype1','Exceptiontype2',Exceptiontype3',...,
   'ExceptiontypeN' are different exception classes that you want
   to handle.

-> Here are some built-in exception classes in python:

   -'Exception': The base class for all built-in exceptions.
   -'ArithmeticError': The base class for arithmetic errors,
     such as 'ZeroDivisionError' and 'OverflowError'.
   -'AssertionError': Raised when an 'assert' statement fails.
   -'AttributeError': Raised when an attribute referance or assignment fails.
   -'EOFError': Raised when 'input()' function hits the end-of-file condition(EOF)
     without reading any data.
   -'FileNotFoundError': Raised when the file or directory is not found by the 
     'open()' function.
   -'ImportError': Raised when a module,package or object cannot be imported.
   -'IndexError': Raised when an index is out of range.
   -'KeyError': Raised when a dictionary key is not found.
   -'NameError': Raised when a variable name is not found in the current namespace.
   -'TypeError': Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of 
    inappropriate type.
   -'ValueError': Raised when an operation or function receives an argument of the 
    right type but an inappropriate value,such as when converting a string to an integer
    and the string does not represent a valid integer.
