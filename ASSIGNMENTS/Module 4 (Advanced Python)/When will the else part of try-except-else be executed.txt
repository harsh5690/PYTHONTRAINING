Que : When will the else part of try-except-else be executed?

-> The 'else' clause in a 'try-except-else' block is executed only when no 
   exceptions are raised in the 'try' block.

-> The syntax of the 'try-except-else' block is as follows:
   
   try:
       # code that might raise an error
   except ExceptionType:
       # handling the exception
   else:
       # executed when no exceptions are raised in the try block


-> Here, the 'try' block contains the code that might raise an exception. if an
   exception of type 'ExceptionType' (or any of its subclasses) is raised in the 
   'try' block,then the corresponding 'except' block is executed to handle the
   exception.If no exception is raised, then the code in the 'else' block is executed.

-> The 'else' clause is useful for writing code that should be executed if the 'try'
   block succeeds without any exceptions.For example.,you might use it to clean up 
   resources or to print a success message.

-> Note that 'else' clause is optional in a 'try-except' block. You can use a 
   'try-except' block without an 'else' clause to catch and handle the exceptions
   without executing any code when no exceptions are raised.
