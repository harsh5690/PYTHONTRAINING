Que : Explain Exception handling. What is an Error in Python?

-> Exception handling is a mechanism in python that allows you
   to handle errors and other exceptional events that occur 
   during program execution.

-> In python, an exception is a runtime error that occurs due to
   some abnormal condition or unexpected event during program 
   execution.

-> When an exception occurs, python raises an error and halts
   program execution.

-> However, with exception handling , you can catch these errors,
   handles them, and continue program execution without crashing
   the program.

-> Exception handling is done using the 'try' and 'except' statements.
   The 'try' statement is used to enclose the code that might raise an
   exception.

-> If an exception occurs within the 'try' block,the program jumps to 
   the corresponding 'except' block, where you can handle the exception.

-> ex., try:
            x = 1/0
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            print("Division by Zero!")

-> An Error in python is an abnormal condition that causes the program
   to halt or behave in an unexpected way. 

-> There are three main types of error in python: 

   1) Syntax errors: It occurs when the python interpreter encounters 
                     an incorrect syntax in the code.
                     -> These errors prevent the code from executing 
                     and must be corrected before the program can run.

   2) Runtime errors: It occurs during program execution when an exception
              	      is raised due to an unexpected event or abnormal
  	 	      condition.
		      ->These errors can be handled using exception
		      handling mechanisms.

   3) Logical errors: It occur when the code runs without errors but
 	 	      produces incorrect results due to a flaw in program's
		      logic.
		      ->These errors are more difficult to detect and 
		      fix than syntax and runtime errors and require careful
		      debugging and testing.
