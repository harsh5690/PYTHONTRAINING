Que : Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for?

-> The 'django-admin.py make messages' command is used in Django to generate or 
   update translation message files for internationalization(i18n) and localization
   (l10n) purposes.

-> In Django, internationalization refers to the process of making your web application
   capable of supporting multiple languages.Localization, on the other hand, involves
   adapting your application to a specific language or region.

-> The 'make messages' command scans the source code and templates of a Django project
   to identify translatable text strings marked with translation functions, such as
   'gettext()','ugettext()', or their lazy versions('gettext_lazy()','ugettext_lazy()').
   It extracts there translatable strings and saves them in language-specific message files.

-> The command searches for translation strings in python code files('.py'), HTML templates('.html'),
   and other supported formats. It collects these strings and organizes them into message files specific
   to each language. These message files are stored in a 'locale' directory within your Django project.

-> Once the message files are generated, they can be translated by language translators using tools like
   'django-admin.py compilemessages', which compiles the translations into binary files that Django can 
   use at runtime.

-> By using the 'make messages' command and the translation infrastructure in Django, you can create 
   multilingual applications and easily manage the translation of your application's user interface 
   and content.
