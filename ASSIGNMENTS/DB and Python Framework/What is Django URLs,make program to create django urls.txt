Que : What is Django URLs?make program to create django urls.

-> In Django, URLs(Uniform Resource Locators) are used to map incoming 
   HTTP requests to the corresponding view functions or class-based views
   that handle those requests.URLs define the routing and navigation structure
   of a Django web application.

-> The Django URL configuration is defined in the 'urls.py' module within each
   Django app. This module contains a collection of URL patterns that specify 
   URL patterns that specify the URL patterns to match and the corresponding 
   view functions to call.

-> To create a Django URL configuration, you need to perform the following steps:

   1) Open the 'urls.py' file within your Django app or create one if it doesn't exist.

   2) Import the necessary modules;
    
	from django.urls import path
	from . import views

   3) Define your URL patterns using the 'path()' function:

	urlpatterns = [
		path('url-pattern/', views.view_function_name, name='url-name'),
		]

-> Here's a breakdown of the components used in the 'path()' function:
   
   - 'url-pattern/' : This is the URL pattern you want to match. It can include variables,
			such as

		'<int:variable_name>' or '<str:variable-name>', to capture dynamic values from the URL.
   
   - 'views.view_function_name': This is the reference to the view function that will be called when the 
			URL pattern is matched.
  
   - 'name='url-name'': This assigns a name to the URL pattern, which can be used to refer to it in your 
			Django templates or when generating URLs programmatically.

   4) Optionally, you can include additional URL patterns by appending them to the 'urlpatterns' list.

   5) In the main project's 'urls.py' file, include the URL patterns of your app by adding the following code:

		
		from django.urls import include
		
		urlpatterns = [
			path('your-app/',include('your-app.urls')),
			]

		replace 'your-app' with the name of your app.

-> That's it! You have created a basic Django URL configuration.
   Remember to replace-'url-pattern/','views.view_function_name',and 'url-name' with your specific URL pattern, 
   view function, and URL name, respectively.

-> By defining URL pattern in Django, you can control how your web application responds to different URLs and 
   navigate users to the appropriate views.
