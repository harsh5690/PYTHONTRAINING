Que : How to check installed version of django?

-> To check the installed version of Django, you can use 
   either of the following methods:

1) Using the command-line interface(CLI): Open a terminal
   or command prompt and enter the following command:
	
	django-admin --version
or

	python -m django --version


2) using Python's interactive shell: Open a terminal or command
   prompt and start the python interactive shell by typing 
   'python' or 'python3', depending on your python installation.
   Once you are in the interactive shell, enter the following commands:



	import django
	print(django.get.version())



   This will import the Django module and display the version number.


-> Both the methods will give you the version of Django installed on
   your system.
