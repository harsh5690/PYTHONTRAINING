Que : Mention what command line can be used to load data into Django?

-> In Django, you can use the 'loaddata' command to load data from fixture
   files into the database.Fixture files are typically in JSON,XML or YAML
   formats and contain serialized data that can be used to populate the
   database with initial or test data.

-> To load data into Django using the command line,follow these steps:

1) Ensure that you have fixture files available.Fixture files are typically
   located in a directory named 'fixtures' within each Django app.

2) Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of
   your Django project

3) Run the following command:


		python manage.py loaddata fixture_file_name


	-> Replace 'fixture_file_name' with the name of your fixture file
 	(including the file extension). If the fixture file is located in 
 	a subdirectory within the 'fixtures' directory, specify the path 
 	relative to the 'fixtures' directory as well.

	-> For example, if your fixture file is named 'data.json' and is 
 	located in the 'fixtures' directory of the app named 'myapp', the 
	command would be:

		
		python manage.py loaddata myapp/fixtures/data.json


	-> By default, Django will look for the fixture file in the 'fixtures'
	directory of all installed apps. If you want to specify a specific app,
	you can prepend the app name to the fixture file name, separated by a colon(':').

	-> For example:

	
		python manage.py loaddata myapp:data.json

	-> Django will deserialize the fixture data and populate the corresponding 
	database tables with the loaded data.

-> The 'loaddata' command is useful for initializing your database with predefined
   data or for loading test data during developement or testing.
