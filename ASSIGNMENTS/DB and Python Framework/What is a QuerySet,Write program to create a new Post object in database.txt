Que : What is a QuerySet?
      Write program to create a new Post object in database:

-> In Django, a QuerySet is a collection of database records or 
   objects that match a specific query. It represents a set of
   results obtained from the database based on certain conditions
   or filters.

-> QuerySets allow you to perform various operations on the data,
   such as filtering, sorting and retrieving specific fields. They
   provide a convenient way to interact with the database and retrieve 
   the data you need.

-> Here's an example program to create a new 'Post' object and save it
   to the database using Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):

  
   1) Define the 'post' model:

		
	from django.db import models
	
	class Post(models.Model):
	    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
	    content = models.TextField()
	    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

	    
	    def __str__(self):
		return self.title

   2) Import the 'Post' model and create a new object:

	
	from your_app.models import Post

	# Create a new Post object
	post = Post(title='First Post', content='This is the content of my first post')

   3) Save the object to the database:

	post.save()


-> The 'save()' method persists the 'post' object in the database. Django automatically 
   generates the necessary SQL queries to create a new record in the 'post' table.

-> You can also chain multiple operations together using the QuerySet API. For example,
   if you want to retrieve all posts created after a specific date, you can do the following:

	
	from django.utils import timezone

	recent_posts = Post.objects.filter(created_at__gte=timezone.now() - timezone.timedelta(days=7))

-> In this example, the 'filter()' method is used to retrieve posts where the 'created_at' field is greater
   than or equal to seven days ago.

-> QuerySets provide a powerful and flexible way to interact with your database in Django, allowing you to 
   perform complex queries and retrieve the data you need for your application.
